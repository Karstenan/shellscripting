# Exercise 2 - Basics of the shell

You will learn to:

- Navigate through files and directories using a shell

## 2.1 Files and directories

:pencil2: List the contents of the directory you are currently standing in

:pencil2: Print the path to the current working directory

:pencil2: List the hidden files (if any) in a directory (hint: in unix, hidden files starts with dot (".ssh"))

:pencil2: List all java files in a directory with human-readable size references ordered
  by the last-modified date.         
:exclamation: If you don't have any java files, try another type of files, preferable text files. (Hint: see the help documentation for the `ls` command's `l`, `t`, `r`, and `h` switches)

:pencil2: Find your java executable.          
:exclamation: If you don't have Java installed, try any other well known executable on your machine.

:pencil2: Use a for loop to print out the first few lines of each file in a directory.
  - Try to do this both as a script and as a one-liner in the shell
ANSWER:  for file in `ls -a`; do head -1 $file; done


:pencil2: Make a variable containing the name of a directory. 
  - Make a test that checks whether the name is a directory or a regular file.
  - Print out the line "This is a directory" if the variable names a directory. This time, print out the name of
  the directory using the variable so that the line reads "commandLineTips.txt
  is not a directory"

:pencil2: List out files in `/var/log/` and listen to the tail end of the most recently
  used log file. 
  
This means that any new messages should appear in your terminal (this may take a few minutes depending on the activity level of your
  machine).               
:question: How do you exit from the live view of the file?

:pencil2: List the contents of your PATH variable

:pencil2: Create a new directory and add this directory to your PATH variable. Verify that it was added by repeating the previous step.
